"""The Celery application instance — one process type, run as either a
worker (executes tasks) or with `--beat` (also schedules them; fine to run
both in one process for a single-node deployment).

Broker/backend/timezone wiring lives in `krutrim_agent_celery_core.factory.build_celery_app`
(shared with any other Celery service in this workspace); this module's own
job is supplying *this* app's name and task list — the community-specific
part. `krutrim_agent_backend` dispatches `precompute_embeddings`
via a separate, minimal Celery *client* of its own
(`krutrim_agent_backend/celery_client.py`) using this task's registered name string,
not by importing this module — so the FastAPI process never pulls in
`numpy`/etc. just to enqueue a job.
