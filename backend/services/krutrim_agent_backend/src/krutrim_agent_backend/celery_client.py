"""A minimal Celery client for dispatching tasks `krutrim_agent_celery` owns, without
depending on that package's code (docker, deepagents, numpy,
...) — just the shared Redis broker URL and a task's registered name string.
`Celery.send_task()` is designed for exactly this: enqueuing a task by name
across process/package boundaries, with no import of the task function
itself required.
