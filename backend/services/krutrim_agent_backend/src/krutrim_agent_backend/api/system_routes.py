"""GET /api/system/extensions — reports which extension hooks and storage
backend are actually active. Read-only status, never
raises on edition drift (that's `krutrim_agent_extensions.selfcheck`'s job, run once
at startup) — this is what an external monitor or the frontend
self-check polls to catch a hook silently reverting to its community
default after a bad deploy/config change. Nothing returned here is
sensitive (implementation class names and config strings, no secrets), so
it's ungated — same posture as `/api/health` and `/api/agents`.
