"""Abstract, storage-agnostic contract every backend must satisfy. `LocalStorage` (see
`local.py`) is the only implementation today. Hierarchy: `Project` -> (`Agent` | `Chat`)
-> `SessionInfo`, keyed by `session_id` alone; see `models.py` for field-level shape.

Every project / agent / chat / session belongs to one user. The owning
`user_id` is the first argument to every create / read / list / mutate call
(the caller passes it — `AuthMiddleware` puts the request's user on
`request.state.user_id`; `LOCAL_USER_ID` when there is no authenticated user).
Reads and lists return only that user's rows; a lookup with a `user_id` that
doesn't own the row raises `KeyError`, exactly like an unknown id. No
cross-user sharing.
