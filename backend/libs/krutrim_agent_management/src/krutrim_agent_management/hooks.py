"""Lightweight extension points fired from inside `Storage` operations.

Today there is exactly one: `session_delete` hooks, run by
`LocalStorage.delete_session` (and therefore by every cascade —
`delete_chat`, `delete_project`) just before a session's row and directory
are removed. `krutrim_agent_rag.cleanup` registers a hook here to drop the
session's vector index (a Qdrant collection, or the on-disk FAISS files)
when its chat is deleted.

The indirection exists so `krutrim_agent_management` never has to import
`krutrim_agent_rag` (which depends on `krutrim_agent_management` — importing
back the other way would be circular). A process that wants the RAG cleanup
imports `krutrim_agent_rag.cleanup` once at startup; a process that never
touches RAG (e.g. the Celery reaper) simply has no hook registered and
`run_session_delete_hooks` is a no-op.
