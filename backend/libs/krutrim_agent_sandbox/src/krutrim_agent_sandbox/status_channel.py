"""Live-status pub/sub for background jobs.

Redis is the only implementation today (`RedisPubSubBackend`) — publish call
sites (the embedding precompute / RAG document tasks) depend on the
`PubSubBackend` ABC, not on `redis` directly, so a future broker swap
(RabbitMQ, per the pending migration plan) means writing one new class —
nothing else changes. Celery's own broker/result-backend config is separate
and already isolated from this module.

`publish()` is deliberately synchronous — a single fire-and-forget Redis
command, not a long-lived loop — consistent with this codebase's sandbox
module already calling the (sync-only) Docker SDK directly from async
methods (see `sandbox/registry.py`) rather than wrapping every quick I/O
call in a thread. The SSE *subscribing* side
(`krutrim_agent_backend/api/status_routes.py`) is a genuinely long-lived async loop
and uses `redis.asyncio` directly instead of this ABC — a different shape
of operation, not part of the publish contract.
