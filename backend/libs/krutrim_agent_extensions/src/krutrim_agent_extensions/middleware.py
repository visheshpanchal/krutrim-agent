"""ASGI middleware that resolves the active extension hooks for every
request. Community ships with all-no-op hooks, so this is a pure
pass-through — it adds `request.state.principal` /
`request.state.visible_agent_keys` without changing any response, and every
route that wants edition-aware behavior (`agents_routes.py`, `agent_run.py`)
reads those instead of importing `krutrim_agent_extensions` hooks directly.
