"""Security/governance hook contracts + their shipped no-op (community) defaults.

Every hook here is optional to override — a private deployment replaces
one or more via `krutrim_agent_extensions.registry.register_hook`, discovered from
`settings.extension_sources`. Nothing upstream (`krutrim_agent_backend`'s
routes, `krutrim_agents_core`) ever imports a concrete implementation directly —
only ever goes through `krutrim_agent_extensions.registry.get_*`.
